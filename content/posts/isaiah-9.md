The chapter starts where God says He will honour Galilee. The people will see light in the darkness and it prophesies the coming of our Saviour.
“For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David’s throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.”
‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭9:6-7‬ ‭NIV‬‬

Suddenly the chapter changes from the good news of the coming of the Messiah to focus on the rebellious, sinful people. God was angered by their sin and rebellion and consequently the people will be punished for their bad behaviour. God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow. I believe God will still punish rebellious and sinful people. We should live holy lives while we await the second coming of Jesus.

“if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.”
‭‭2 Chronicles‬ ‭7:14‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.”
‭‭Titus‬ ‭2:11-14‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.”
‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭12:14‬ ‭NIV‬‬
