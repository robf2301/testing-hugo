  <p>Don’t be suprised if people that know you don’t embrace your calling.<br>Jeremiah was from Anathoth and those were also the people that wanted to kill him for prophesying God’s messages.</p>
  <p>Jeremiah 1:1 MEV<br>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,</p>
  <p>Jeremiah 11:21 MEV<br>Therefore thus says the LORD of the men of Anathoth who seek your life, saying, "Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD so that you not die by our hand."</p>
  <p>Jesus didn’t do many miracles in his home town Nazareth. The people’s unbelief was a problem. Jesus left Nazareth and went to other towns and cities where everybody was healed. You don’t need people’s approval to do God’s work. We must also be careful not to reject people because of familiarity.</p>
  <p>Luke 4:24 MEV<br>He also said, "Truly, I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own country.</p>
  <p>Matthew 13:57-58 MEV<br>And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house." [58] And He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</p>
  <p>Mark 6:4-6 MEV<br>Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house." [5] He could not do any miracles there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them. [6] And He was amazed because of their unbelief. Then He went to the surrounding villages, teaching.</p>
