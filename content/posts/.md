  <p>ISAAC STAYED AT BEER - LAHAI -ROI</p>
  <p>Read Genesis 16, 21, 24, 25 and 26.</p>
  <p>Abraham and Sarah got tired of waiting on the Lord for a child and made their own plans. Hagar the servant girl got pregnant with Abraham’s child. Hagar despised Sarah and in response Sarah mistreated her servant. Hagar left and wandered into the desert. The Angel of the Lord found Hagar at a well. Hagar shared her misfortune, and the Angel comforted her and shared God’s plans with her. Hagar called the well, Beer - Lahai- Roi. It means “Well of the One who sees me”.&nbsp;<br>Abraham was 86 years old when Ishmael was born and had to wait another 14 years for Isaac’s birth. After Sarah’s death, Abraham had 6 more sons. Isaac was the son of the covenant.</p>
  <p>Genesis 25:5-6 TPT<br>Abraham gave all that he possessed to Isaac, [6] but to his sons by his concubines he gave gifts while he was still living. He sent them all away eastward, separating them from his son Isaac.</p>
  <p>Abraham didn’t want Isaac to marry a Canaanite. Isaac married his cousin Rebekah. Isaac stayed at the Well of Lahai-Roi, the place where Hagar had an encounter with God.</p>
  <p>Genesis 24:62 KJV<br>And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai–roi; for he dwelt in the south country.</p>
  <p>Genesis 25:11 KJV<br>And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai–roi.</p>
  <p>Hagar encountered God; Isaac stayed in God’s presence and was blessed. Isaac sowed during a famine and reaped a hundredfold. He dug wells and found living water. Abraham is a prophetic picture of Father God and Isaac is a prophetic picture of Jesus. Abraham was prepared to offer Isaac as a sacrifice. Jesus continuously stayed in contact with His heavenly Father. We should do the same.</p>
  <p>Galatians 4:28 KJV<br>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</p>
