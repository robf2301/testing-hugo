  <p>Genesis 2:8-9 KJV<br>And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. [9] And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>
  <p>Once Adam and Eve ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil nothing was stopping them from eating of the tree of life. This would have caused them to live forever while knowing evil. In contrast eternity in Heaven shields us from knowing evil. There are no worries, tears or pain in Heaven. I assume they didn’t eat from the tree of life before these events else they would have lived forever knowing evil. &nbsp;Even though Adam and Eve were disobedient God still protected them.</p>
  <p>Genesis 3:22-24 KJV<br>And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: [23] Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. [24] So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</p>
  <p>The tree of life was guarded by angels to prevent people from eating of it. Solomon considered the tree of life as a metaphor for wisdom, fulfilled desires and wholesome speech.</p>
  <p>Proverbs 3:18 KJV<br>She (Wisdom) is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.</p>
  <p>Proverbs 13:12 KJV<br>Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.</p>
  <p>Proverbs 15:4 KJV<br>A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit.</p>
  <p>Some people think Jesus was crucified on the tree of life. The New Testament states that Jesus was a hung on a tree, but doesn’t mention anything more about the tree - Acts 5:30, 10:39, 13:29, Galations 3:13, 1 Peter 2:24. Others reckon the tree of life was a shadow of Jesus. Isaiah refers to Jesus as a shoot/rod that will grow from the stem of Jesse (David’s dad) and a branch will form and the Spirit of the Lord will rest on Him - Isaiah 11:1-5.</p>
  <p>The message John had to bring to the church was that those who overcome will eat from the tree of life in paradise. If we keep following Jesus we will receive eternal life. The tree of life bears fruit for healing. We know there will be no disease in Heaven.&nbsp;<br>As Christians we have so much to look forward to. This is what keeps us going even when we go through temporary difficulties.</p>
  <p>Revelation 2:7 KJV<br>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</p>
  <p>Revelation 22:1-2 KJV<br>And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. [2] In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</p>
  <p>Revelation 22:14 KJV<br>Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.</p>
