I’ve read this so many times, but never really understood what it meant.

“Jesus then began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed. Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully. He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed. “He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ “But the tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard. “What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others. Haven’t you read this passage of Scripture: “ ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?””
‭‭Mark‬ ‭12:1-11‬ ‭NIV‬‬

God made the Earth for us to live on. He provides us with everything we need. He even sent His son to ensure our salvation. He sent the Holy Spirit that we will never be alone. Scripture says all good things come from God and it rains on the just and unjust. Do you repay God’s goodness with love, adoration and praise, or do you reject Him as Saviour?

If you die today will you go to Heaven?  Pray with me to accept Him as your Saviour. Father, I repent of my sins (you tell Him the specifics). Thank you that I can accept Jesus as my Saviour. I know my life will never be the same. Wash me clean. Holy Spirit come live inside of me and communicate with me. Thank you that you love me and I surrender control of my life to you. Thank you that I can walk in authority and be everything you made me to be. Amen.
