A few times over the last couple of weeks God has reminded me that I have resurrection power. It’s a fact that all spirit-filled Christians have resurrection power living inside of them.
“Yes, God raised Jesus to life! And since God’s Spirit of Resurrection lives in you, he will also raise your dying body to life by the same Spirit that breathes life into you!”
‭‭Romans‬ ‭8:11‬ ‭TPT‬‬
“For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God.”
‭‭Romans‬ ‭8:14‬ ‭NIV‬‬
“Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?””
‭‭John‬ ‭11:25-26‬ ‭NIV‬‬

Resurrection power will give us eternal life, but we also have resurrection power to use here on Earth. I believe we need resurrection power to fulfill the great commission.
“Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.””
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭28:18-20‬ ‭NIV‬‬
“He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.””
‭‭Mark‬ ‭16:15-18‬ ‭NIV‬‬
“He told them, “This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.””
‭‭Luke‬ ‭24:46-49‬ ‭NIV‬‬
“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.””
‭‭Acts‬ ‭1:8‬ ‭NIV‬‬

It’s time that Christians realize that the great commission is for everyone; not only for pastors, ministers or leaders. That means all of us need the power of the Holy Spirit.

“And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs after Jesus’ resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭27:50-53‬ ‭NIV‬‬

I believe resurrection power gives us eternal life one day, but it’s also for now. We can use it to change the atmosphere here on Earth. Isaiah 60 states that both the light and darkness increase on Earth. The light can only increase if Christians spread the light. How do we spread the light?
 1. Tell people about Jesus. Talk about His goodness.
 2. Heal the sick. Miracles still happen today and Jesus said His disciples will even do greater things than He did.
 3. Drive out demons.
 4. Speak in tongues.
 5. Raise people from the dead like Jesus did in John 11(Lazarus) and Mark 5(Jairus’ daughter). I’ve heard that when David Hogan is around, older people ask him not to pray for them when they die, because they are raised from the dead when he does. In David’s ministry it became natural to pray for people when they die.
 6. Prayer
 7. Fasting
 8. Worship


“With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God’s grace was so powerfully at work in them all”
‭‭Acts‬ ‭4:33‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead.”
‭‭Philippians‬ ‭3:10-11‬ ‭NIV‬‬

A powerless church and powerless Christians were never part of God’s plans. Remind yourself today that Jesus’ precious blood paid for you to have resurrection power.
