Faith is believing for things you cannot see.  
“Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.” ‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭11:1‬ ‭NIV‬‬  
Hebrews 11 is the faith chapter in the Bible. It’s a summary of miracles that people received by having faith in God. It speaks about the Red Sea that parted for the Israelites, 100 year old Sarah giving birth to baby Isaac, Noah’s ark, kingdoms that were conquered, lions’s mouths were closed, healing miracles and even people being raised from the dead.  

To increase your faith, read and listen to the Word and also people’s testimonies.  
“So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10:17‬ ‭KJV‬‬

‭‭Jude‬ ‭1:3‬ ‭NIV‬‬
