To surrender means to stop resisting and to submit to God’s authority.  You stop living a life where your selfish needs come first and start following God’s plans for your life. Through your process of surrendering to God you will find your destiny and purpose on Earth. In order to surrender we need to let go of some things and embrace the new things that come on our path.

“In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples.”
‭‭Luke‬ ‭14:33‬ ‭NIV‬‬

‘“When you follow me as my disciple, you must put aside your father, your mother, your wife, your sisters, your brothers—yes, you will even seem as though you hate your own life. This is the price you’ll pay to be considered one of my followers. And anyone who comes to me must be willing to share my cross and experience it as his own, or he cannot be considered to be my disciple.”
‭‭Luke‬ ‭14:26-27‬ ‭TPT‬‬

“This is the (new) covenant I will establish with the people of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.”
‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭8:10‬ ‭NIV

“Jesus gave them this answer: “Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.”
‭‭John‬ ‭5:19-20‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.”

“Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.”
