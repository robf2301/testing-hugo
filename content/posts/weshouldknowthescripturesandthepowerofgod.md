  <p>The Sadducees didn’t believe in the resurrection and questioned Jesus. Jesus’ response was that they didn’t know the Scriptures nor the power of God.</p>
  <p>Mark 12:24 MEV<br>Jesus answered them, "Do you not err, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?</p>
  <p>Joshua pondered on the Word of God.</p>
  <p>Joshua 1:8 MEV<br>This Book of the Law must not depart from your mouth. Meditate on it day and night so that you may act carefully according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way successful, and you will be wise.</p>
  <p>Paul knew the Scriptures and the power of God.</p>
  <p>Philippians 3:10-11 TPT<br>And I continually long to know the wonders of Jesus and to experience the overflowing power of his resurrection working in me. I will be one with him in his sufferings and become like him in his death. [11] Only then will I be able to experience complete oneness with him in his resurrection from the realm of death.</p>
  <p>Ephesians 6:10 MEV<br>Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.</p>
  <p>We should know the Scriptures and the power of God.</p>
  <p>2 Timothy 3:16-17 MEV<br>All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,<br>that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.</p>
  <p>Psalm 119:105 MEV<br>Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.</p>
  <p>Romans 1:16 MEV<br>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. For it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>
  <p>2 Timothy 1:7-8 MEV<br>For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and love, and self-control. [8] So do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, His prisoner. But share in the sufferings of the gospel by the power of God,</p>
  <p>Acts 1:8 MEV<br>But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you shall be My witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."</p>
