Our alarm went off at 2h30 one morning. There was nothing wrong, but I felt that it was a warning from God. Later I read that Jennifer Eivaz also wrote about it in her book ‘The Intercessor’s handbook’.
“Ron ( Jennifer’s husband) carries the heart of a watchman for our home. He guards and protects it, responding to any alarms, no matter what time of night. In the Bible, a watchman was a protector who watched over crops, city gates or walls (see Isaiah 62:6; Jeremiah 51:12; Ezekiel 33:2–3). When an enemy approached, the watchman alerted the people by sounding an alarm. In the same way, God is sounding spiritual alarms to His watchmen and watchwomen. He is saying, Wake up. Be alert. Take out the bad guys trying to break in!”

Scriptures
“Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.”
‭‭Psalms‬ ‭127:1‬ ‭NIV

“This is what the Lord says to me: “Go, post a lookout and have him report what he sees. When he sees chariots with teams of horses, riders on donkeys or riders on camels, let him be alert, fully alert.” And the lookout shouted, “Day after day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower; every night I stay at my post.”
‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭21:6-8‬ ‭NIV‬‬

““Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me.”
‭‭Ezekiel‬ ‭3:17‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“Son of man, speak to your people and say to them: ‘When I bring the sword against a land, and the people of the land choose one of their men and make him their watchman,”
‭‭Ezekiel‬ ‭33:2‬ ‭NIV

“If when he sees the sword coming upon the land, he blows the trumpet and warns the people,”
‭‭Ezekiel‬ ‭33:3‬ ‭AMPC‬‬

“But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people and the sword comes and takes someone’s life, that person’s life will be taken because of their sin, but I will hold the watchman accountable for their blood.’”
‭‭Ezekiel‬ ‭33:6‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“Ephraim was [intended to be] a watchman with my God [and a prophet to the surrounding nations]; but he, that prophet, has become a fowler's snare in all his ways. There is enmity, hostility, and persecution in the house of his God.”
‭‭Hosea‬ ‭9:8‬ ‭AMPC‬‬

“I have posted watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the Lord, give yourselves no rest,”
‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭62:6‬ ‭NIV‬‬

God rebuked Israel’s watchmen.
“Israel’s watchmen are blind, they all lack knowledge; they are all mute dogs, they cannot bark; they lie around and dream, they love to sleep. They are dogs with mighty appetites; they never have enough. They are shepherds who lack understanding; they all turn to their own way, they seek their own gain.”
‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭56:10-11‬ ‭NIV‬‬

Characteristics of a watchman.
 - They must be able to see and hear. In a sense they are the eyes and ears for a group of people. I believe you need a strong prophetic gift to be a watchman.
 - They need knowledge, wisdom and understanding.
 - They must have a voice to speak/warn people.
 - They can’t be lazy, must be alert, day and night.
 - They need to be content.
 - They must be shepherds. (Take care of people)
 - Judgement will come to a watchman that fails to warn people.
 - They must be selfless and love people.
 - Watchman are appointed by God.
 - They must be obedient to God and have an intimate relationship with God.

Watchmen can only bring God’s warning, it’s people’s own responsibility to listen and take the warning seriously.
“I appointed watchmen over you and said, ‘Listen to the sound of the trumpet!’ But you said, ‘We will not listen.’”
‭‭Jeremiah‬ ‭6:17‬ ‭NIV‬‬
