Often Christians lack identity. They struggle to understand that Jesus paid the full price and because of that  Father God sees them as perfect. For various reasons people struggle to feel loved and cared for. The truth is that God is love and if you read your Bible you will see it. Stop believing the lie of satan that you are not good enough. People will sin and God gives them opportunity to repent. Then He will bless them over and over again. Look at King David that had a man killed to get his wife, Bathsheba. God still called him a man after His own heart. If you repent, God will always forgive you.

It helps to repeat Scripture to remind yourself of God’s love for you and to get rid of the victim (orphan) spirit.
- I know the plans God has for me, plans to prosper me and give me a future. Jer 29:11
- I’m the head and not the tail. Deut 28:13
- All things work out together for my good. Rom 8:28
- I’m wonderfully and fearfully made. Ps 139:14
- I’m made in the image of Father God. Ps 1:27
- Don’t be afraid, God is with you. Jos 1:9
- I can do all things through God who gives me strength. Phil 4:13
- God loves you so much that His son died for you. John 3:16

God wants you to prosper and be blessed.

“So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭6:31-34‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.”
‭‭John‬ ‭15:7-8‬ ‭NIV‬‬

Once you’ve got your identity as son/daughter of the King, you can enjoy your inheritance. Jesus died and left us an inheritance here on Earth. Our inheritance is power and authority. God told Adam and Eve to rule over the Earth. Jesus overcame Hell and obtained the keys for us to have even more power and authority.

“I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭16:19‬ ‭NIV‬‬

We need that power and authority in order to obey God’s call on our lives.
We cannot follow Jesus’ instruction to us as disciples without power and authority.

“Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭10:8‬ ‭NIV‬‬

We read about how the disciples grew from immature Christ-followers to real disciples that spoke with authority and had the power to cast out demons. That is still God’s desire for His disciples today. Jesus said you will do even greater things than He did.
