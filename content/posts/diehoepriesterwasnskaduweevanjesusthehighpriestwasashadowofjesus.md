  <p><strong>DIE HOËPRIESTER WAS ‘N SKADUWEE VAN JESUS</strong></p>
  <p>Daar was 6 vrystede in Israel waar iemand kon gaan woon as hy per ongeluk iemand se dood veroorsaak het. Na die hoëpriester se dood kon die mense terugkeer na hulle families. Hierdie mense was verwyder van hulle families totdat hulle hoëpriester gesterf het. Die hoëpriester was ‘n skaduwee van Jesus wat sou kom. Jesus was ons hoëpriester en na Sy dood het ons deel geword van God se familie - Hebreërs 5. Ons is nie langer slawe van sonde nie; ons is nou kinders van God wat vergifnis ontvang vir ons sonde. Niks kan ons nou van God se liefde skei nie.</p>
  <p>“Want hy moet in sy vrystad bly tot die dood van die hoëpriester; maar ná die dood van die hoëpriester mag die een wat 'n doodslag begaan het, teruggaan na die land waar sy besitting lê.”<br>‭‭NÚMERI‬ ‭35‬:‭28‬ ‭AFR53‬‬</p>
  <p>“Maar in al hierdie dinge is ons meer as oorwinnaars deur Hom wat ons liefgehad het. Want ek is versekerd dat geen dood of lewe of engele of owerhede of magte of teenwoordige of toekomende dinge of hoogte of diepte of enige ander skepsel ons sal kan skei van die liefde van God wat daar in Christus Jesus, onse Here, is nie.”<br>‭‭ROMEINE‬ ‭8‬:‭37‬-‭39‬ ‭AFR53‬‬</p>
  <p><strong>THE HIGH PRIEST WAS A SHADOW OF JESUS</strong></p>
  <p>In Israel there were 6 cities of refuge where people who killed someone by accident had to stay. They were separated from their families untill the high priest died. After his death they could be reunited with their families. The high priest was a shadow of Jesus that would come. Jesus was our high priest and after His death we became part of God’s family- Hebrews 5. We are no longer slaves of sin; we are now children of God that received forgiveness for our sins. Nothing can now separate us from God’s love.</p>
  <p>“because the manslayer should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the manslayer may return to the land of his possession.”<br>‭‭Numbers‬ ‭35‬:‭28‬ ‭MEV‬‬</p>
  <p>“No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, neither angels nor principalities nor powers, neither things present nor things to come, neither height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”<br>‭‭Romans‬ ‭8‬:‭37‬-‭39‬ ‭MEV‬‬</p>
