  <p>I had a dream where I saw 3 kinds of cake in a glass counter display. I thought I’m keeping the treats for the cell group to enjoy. The next moment a friend of mine walked in and cut a huge slice of cake and then ate it.</p>
  <p>The 3 reminds me of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Cake is a special treat and not something we eat everyday. We can’t eat cake all the time because it’s expensive, unhealthy and unnecessary. Or we should first eat healthy food and then only we can have cake. We can’t eat too much cake we might feel sick. We should share and leave some for our family or friends.</p>
  <p>Here on earth we have so many restrictions and one tends to apply them to God. My friend didn’t ask permission to eat the cake; she just took a slice. Her name means “God is bountiful”. There is more than enough of Him for everybody. We have free access to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit all the time. We don’t need an appointment or permission to talk to Him. We don’t have to wait for morning/evening prayer time, the cell group or church to talk to Jesus.</p>
  <p>We should experience God in a way that gives us more satisfaction than eating a slice of cake (or whatever your favourite treat is). Sitting in His presence brings peace and healing to your soul and body. Don’t leave it for a special occasion. Enter His presence today and taste and see that He is good.</p>
  <p>Psalm 34:8 MEV<br>Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him.</p>
  <p>Psalm 103:1-5 MEV<br>Bless the LORD, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless His holy name. [2] Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits, [3] who forgives all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases, [4] who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies, [5] who satisfies your mouth with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.</p>
  <p>Psalm 46:10 MEV<br>Be still and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.</p>
  <p>Psalm 100:1-5 MEV<br>Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth! [2] Serve the LORD with gladness; come before His presence with singing. [3] Know that the LORD, He is God; it is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture. [4] Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise; be thankful to Him, and bless His name. [5] For the LORD is good; His mercy endures forever, and His faithfulness to all generations.</p>
