Everything God planned for us is written in the book of life. We must navigate it with the Holy Spirit’s help for it to happen. It is all the good things that God planned ahead of time.

“You saw who you created me to be before I became me! Before I’d ever seen the light of day, the number of days you planned for me were already recorded in your book.”
‭‭Psalms‬ ‭139:16‬ TPT

“Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?”
‭‭Psalms‬ ‭56:8‬ ‭KJV‬‬

People who go to Heaven have their names written in the book of life. It’s already written down. I believe God wrote down everybody’s names in the book. He doesn’t want to blot out names. It is only people that willingly choose not to follow Him that get blotted out. God is love and His heart’s desire is for everyone to go to Heaven.

“But now, please forgive their sin—but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written.” The Lord replied to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book.”

“Pile on them the guilt of their sins. Don’t let them ever go free. Leave them out of your list of the living! Blot them out of your book of life! Never name them as your own!”
‭‭Psalms‬ ‭69:27-28‬ ‭TPT‬‬

“The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out the name of that person from the book of life, but will acknowledge that name before my Father and his angels.”
‭‭Revelation‬ ‭3:5‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.”
‭‭Revelation‬ ‭20:15 NIV


Deliverance will come to those whose names are written in the Book of Life.

“And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.”
‭‭Daniel‬ ‭12:1‬ ‭KJV‬‬

“Then those who feared the Lord talked with each other, and the Lord listened and heard. A scroll of remembrance was written in his presence concerning those who feared the Lord and honored his name.”
‭‭Malachi‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the Judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,”
‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭12:23‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.””
