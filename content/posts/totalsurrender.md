  <p>Mark 12:41-44 TPT<br>Then he sat down near the offering box, watching all the people dropping in their coins. Many of the rich would put in very large sums, [42] but a destitute widow walked up and dropped in two small copper coins, worth less than a penny. [43] Jesus called his disciples to gather around and then said to them, “I tell you the truth, this poor widow has given a larger offering than any of the wealthy. [44] For the rich only gave out of their surplus, but she sacrificed out of her poverty and gave to God all that she had to live on, which was everything she had.”</p>
  <p>The widow gave only 2 copper coins.&nbsp;<br>MEV footnote: “Greek 2 lepta - A lepton means small or thin and it was worth only a fraction of a penny. A Jewish bronze or copper coin, it was the smallest coin circulated.”<br>KJV: “2 mites”<br>Thayer Lexicon: A mite was worth about one fifth of a cent.</p>
  <p>Imagine Jesus watching people putting R100 and R200 notes in the offering box. Suddenly a poor widow comes and give 2 cents and Jesus says it’s worth more than all the paper notes. The widow gave all that she had and that is what Jesus wants. It was never about the amount of money, but about the condition of the people’s hearts. He wants our total surrender. When we fully submit to the Father, Holy Spirit can work through us.</p>
  <p>James 4:7 MEV<br>Therefore submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</p>
  <p>Galatians 5:24-25 MEV<br>Those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts. [25] If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</p>
  <p>Galatians 2:20 MEV<br>I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.<br>&nbsp;</p>
