Submit to God, but at the same time take authority.

We were made to rule.
“Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”
God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.””
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭1:26, 28‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“And he who overcomes (is victorious) and who obeys My commands to the [very] end [doing the works that please Me], I will give him authority and power over the nations;”
‭‭Revelation‬ ‭2:26‬ ‭AMPC‬‬

From these scriptures it’s clear that God gave us authority to rule the earth. Jesus had the same authority and used it to make people’s lives better.  We have the same responsibilty.

“I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.”
‭‭Galatians‬ ‭2:20‬ ‭NIV‬‬
We can’t have our own agendas. Our purpose is to rule like Jesus ruled; from a place of love and fully submitted to fulfill God’s plans on Earth. We have authority to do God’s will.
“Jesus gave them this answer: “Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.”
‭‭John‬ ‭5:19‬ ‭NIV‬‬
