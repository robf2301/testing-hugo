“Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. Then he said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard him say it.”
‭‭Mark‬ ‭11:13-14‬ ‭NIV‬‬

Jesus expected the fig tree to have fruit even out of season. At first I found this strange since God made the seasons. Then I realised Jesus was used to fruit all year round in Heaven. Jesus was used to the culture of Heaven - what am I used to? Do I focus on my failures and shortcomings or do I have a Heaven oriented mindset? It also shows a picture of us bearing fruit all the time, even in difficult seasons. A picture of the persecuted church that carries fruit in the most difficult circumstances.
According to ‘The Dream Book’, written by Barbara Claassen, figs symbolise love and goodness. We read that Jesus reached the tree, but he found nothing. There weren’t any figs. When He returns will He find love and goodness (figs) or will He find nothing?

Jesus told the fig tree that it will never bear fruit again and the next day the fig tree was dried out. It shows the power of words. The tongue has power over both life and death.
When the disciples pointed out that the tree had withered, Jesus spoke about having faith. If we really believe, we will receive whatever we ask for in prayer.
““Have faith in God,” Jesus answered. “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”
‭‭Mark‬ ‭11:22-24‬ ‭NIV
