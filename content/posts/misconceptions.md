I feel people get easily mislead by certain things. If you watch/read  the news here in South Africa you hear negative things all the time. You hear how weak the rand is or how expensive medical aid will become or about people sadly losing their lives. It’s all real, but sad and depressing news. Use the news as an opportunity to pray instead of expecting the worst. Pray and decree financial stability, that our leaders will know God, for the safety of all our people. Pray and decree peace over our country.

If you can’t turn to God and still see the goodness of God you will become negative and depressed yourself. Yes, all these things happened, but a lot of good things also happened. You never hear about a miraculous healing or financial breakthrough in the news. Christian news only ends up in the news when there is a scandal attached to it. Therefore it’s important to surround yourself with Christian news. Read about miracles that still happen today. Read about the goodness of God. Write down everytime God does something for you and remind yourself of it when you start feeling depressed. Don’t absorb the atmosphere of the world. You can change the atmosphere by talking about the goodness of God when other people want to talk about the weak rand. If you can remain hopeful despite circumstances I believe you will be victorious. Remember God is on your side and wants the best for you.

“And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.”
‭‭Romans‬ ‭8:28‬ ‭NIV‬‬
