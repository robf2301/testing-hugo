  <p>David was called to be a ruler and king. He wasn’t born as the son of a king nor was he the oldest son. David was in fact the youngest son of Jesse and he had to take care of the sheep. Being a shepherd prepared him for his future. David was chosen and God was with him. David knew his assignment was about God and His kingdom. David knew he had to turn to God during difficulties. David was persecuted by Saul even after Samuel anointed him as king. David had to play on the harp to keep Saul calm. David never touched or hurt Saul. Saul even took David’s wife back. David’s men wanted to kill him. After many years of persecution David became king over Judah for 7 years. Then only he became king over Judah and Israel and ruled for another 33 years in Jerusalem.</p>
  <p>1 Samuel 30:6 MEV<br>David was greatly distressed, for the people talked of stoning him, because all the people were bitter in spirit, each over his sons and daughters. But David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.</p>
  <p>2 Samuel 5:10,12 MEV<br>[10] David went on and became great, because the LORD, the God of Hosts, was with him.&nbsp;<br>[12] Then David understood that the LORD had appointed him king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.</p>
  <p>God has chosen you and has a calling and purpose for you. Maybe it’s not as glamarous as being a king, but it’s God’s will for your life. Like David you might be going through a lot of resistance and trouble. Encourage yourself in the Lord and don’t give up. All the resistance is probably a sign that you are on the right path. It may take time, but at the right time the Lord will position you. You will become great when you walk with Jesus and let Holy Spirit lead you. Our purpose is always to search Jesus and glorify the Father. In the process we will fulfill our calling and other people will be blessed through it.</p>
