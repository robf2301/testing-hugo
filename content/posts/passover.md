  <p>Matthew 26: 17-30<br>Mark 14:12-26&nbsp;<br>Luke 22:7-23-29</p>
  <p>As I was studying Passover in the Bible I noticed that Jesus and His 12 disciples ate Jesus’ last Passover alone in a room. I’ve done a lot of studying on the significance of numbers and what God says through certain numbers. The Holy Spirit highlighted 12+1=13. For a long time I’ve known that 12 represents God’s government. Twelve tribes in the Old Testament, 12 disciples in the New Testament, Jesus was 12 when His parents found Him in the temple teaching, Jairus’ daughter was 12, 12 hours in a day and night and 12 months in a year. Only recently I’ve learned that the number 13 represents love and unity. The chapter about love in scripture is found in 1 Corinthians 13 and has 13 verses.</p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>“Greater love has no man than this: that a man lay down his life for his friends.”<br>‭‭John‬ ‭15:13‬ ‭MEV‬‬</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Holy Spirit was showing me all of this on 13 April. I knew then God was saying He’s the One that made all the difference in the lives of the 12 disciples. They changed from unschooled fisherman to Holy Spirit filled world changers. They had authority and confidence, and could heal the sick and drive out demons. He came to set captives free and bring life in abundance. Jesus’ love changed the 12 disciples’ lives.</p>
  <p>If you look at the first Passover in Exodus 12 you see 12 tribes that were in desperate need of salvation. God moved the 12 tribes out of slavery and captivity into freedom. He was with them as a cloud during the day and as a fire column during the night. When He moved, the Israelites moved and when He stopped, the 12 tribes stopped. Again the 12 needed the One to change their lives. God even changed the Passover month (named Adar) to the first month of the year (Jews have a religious calender and a civil calender) implying that it’s a fresh start. Every time we celebrate Easter we are reminded that Jesus became the last, perfect, sacrificial Lamb. We have the same resurrection power living inside us. Easter is another oppurtunity to make a fresh start.</p>
  <p>We know that from the beginning (Genesis 1:29) God gave the instruction to rule and reign over the Earth. If you look at the words in Exodus 12:11 you will see that it’s the same as Ephesians 6:14-15. The 12 tribes had to be ready with their waist girdled, shoes on their feet and staff in their hand. The 12 tribes had to be ready for warfare. When you make a fresh start you can expect warfare, but it’s not a problem since you have the One living inside you and you have a full set of armour to protect you. You can rule and reign and be a worldchanger.</p>
  <p>Jesus didn’t leave us alone, He left the Holy Spirit with us. We know God is one, but also three (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). Today Christians represent God’s government here on Earth. You are part of the 12 and the One is still the solution to all the problems of this world.</p>
  <p>Happy Easter! ✝️🤍</p>
