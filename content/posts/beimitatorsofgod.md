  <p>Read Ephesians 5.</p>
  <p>Ephesians 5:1 KJV<br>Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;</p>
  <p>Ephesians 5:1 TPT<br>Be imitators of God in everything you do, for then you will represent your Father as his beloved sons and daughters.</p>
  <p>The KJV uses the word followers, while other translations use the word imitators. The Greek word “mimetos” means to mimic God.&nbsp;<br>An imitator is someone who copies the behaviour or actions of another - Oxford Dictionary. The 12 started as followers or disciples but changed into imitators of Jesus. Jesus copied/mimicked/imitated Godly behaviour. We should do the same.</p>
  <p>John 5:19 TPT<br>So Jesus said, “I speak to you eternal truth. The Son is unable to do anything from himself or through his own initiative. I only do the works that I see the Father doing, for the Son does the same works as his Father.</p>
  <p>We should&nbsp;<br>• walk in love and be totally surrendered to the Father in every area of our life.&nbsp;<br>• be a sweet-smelling fragrance<br>• stay away from sin<br>• guard our speech<br>• not be deceived by fools or deceptive teachings<br>• have revelation light<br>• produce Godly fruit<br>• have nothing to do with evil<br>• be awake and aware<br>• be full of wisdom<br>• spend our time wisely<br>• not get drunk on wine (rebellion)<br>• be filled with the Holy Spirit<br>• always give thanks, sing praises and quote scripture<br>• support each other in love<br>• love and be devoted to our spouse, since marriage is a shadow of our relationship with Jesus, our Bridegroom<br>• be holy, pure and mature Christians.</p>
  <p>Ephesians 5:17 TPT<br>And don’t live foolishly for then you will have discernment to fully understand God’s will.</p>
  <p>Ephesians 5:27 TPT<br>All that he does in us is designed to make us a mature church for his pleasure, until we become a source of praise to him—glorious and radiant, beautiful and holy, without fault or flaw.</p>
  <p>Luke 2:52 KJV<br>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</p>
  <p>Imitators of Christ won’t be foolish but will be Holy Spirit led. The Word encourages us to grow into mature Christians that represent our Beloved Father.</p>
