  <p>Matthew 17:2 TPT<br>Then Jesus’ appearance was dramatically altered. A radiant light as bright as the sun poured from his face. And his clothing became luminescent—dazzling like lightning. He was transfigured before their very eyes.</p>
  <p>Mark 9:2 TPT<br>After six days, Jesus took Peter and the two brothers, Jacob and John, and hiked up a high mountain to be alone. And Jesus’ appearance was dramatically altered, for he was transfigured before their very eyes!</p>
  <p>The word transfigured comes from the Greek word metamorphoō -&nbsp;<br>STRONG’S G3339 - which means changed in form.&nbsp;<br>OXFORD DICTIONARY: Typically metamorphosis involves the transformation from an immature stage into 2 or more distinct mature stages. It is a change of the form or nature of a thing or person into a completely different one.</p>
  <p>Mark 16:12 KJV<br>After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.</p>
  <p>Mark 16:12 TPT<br>After this, Jesus appeared to two of the disciples, who were on their way to another village, appearing in a form they did not recognize.</p>
  <p>We are all familiar with the process of metamorphosis in nature, but the disciples saw Jesus being transformed. After Jesus was resurrected He appeared in a form (STRONG’S G3444 - morphē) where people close to Him couldn’t recognize Him. We know Moses also had a type of metamorphosis when he spent time with the Father on the mountain.</p>
  <p>Exodus 34:29-30 MEV<br>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of testimony in the hands of Moses, when he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone while he talked with Him. [30] So when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, amazingly, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.</p>
  <p>The deceiver also attempts to be an angel of light and therefore it’s no suprise that false teachers pretend to be transformed (STRONG’S G3345 - metaschēmatizō).</p>
  <p>2 Corinthians 11:13-15 KJV<br>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. [14] And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. [15] Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</p>
  <p>We have the oppurtunity to go through a process of metamorphosis to become more like Christ. Very often I hear Christians say that they are sinners and can’t be like Christ. If you are one of those people it is time to repent. When you repent your sins are forgiven. Jesus paid for you to be transformed. Renewing our minds with God’s truth is an integral part of our metamorphosis. You have to go through the process of metamorphosis to become more and more like Christ.</p>
  <p>Romans 12:2 TPT<br>Stop imitating the ideals and opinions of the culture around you, but be inwardly transformed (G3339 - metamorphoō) by the Holy Spirit through a total reformation of how you think. This will empower you to discern God’s will as you live a beautiful life, satisfying and perfect in his eyes.</p>
  <p>2 Corinthians 3:18 TPT<br>We can all draw close to him with the veil removed from our faces. And with no veil we all become like mirrors who brightly reflect the glory of the Lord Jesus. We are being transfigured into his very image as we move from one brighter level of glory to another. And this glorious transfiguration comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.</p>
  <p>Philippians 3:20-21 TPT<br>But we are a colony of heaven on earth as we cling tightly to our life-giver, the Lord Jesus Christ, [21] who will transform our humble bodies and transfigure us into the identical likeness of his glorified body. And using his matchless power, he continually subdues everything to himself.</p>
