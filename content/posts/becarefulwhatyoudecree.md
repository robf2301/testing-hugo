  <p>So many people are decreeing bad things over themselves, but also over our country. There are negative posts about loadshedding, finances and our future everywhere on social media. Jesus is the truth, the way and the life. Everything Jesus said happened; people were healed and the fig tree died when Jesus cursed it. If we use our authority the same will happen.&nbsp;<br>The tongue is our rudder. Is your tongue steering your life closer to Jesus or closer to the enemy? We will be held accountable for what we say. Letâ€™s speak life over ourselves and our country.</p>
  <p>Job 22:28 MEV<br>You will also declare a matter, and it will be established unto you; and the light will shine upon your ways.</p>
  <p>Matthew 12:36-37 MEV<br>But I say to you that for every idle word that men speak, they will give an account on the Day of Judgment. [37] For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned."</p>
  <p>James 3:2-12 MEV<br>We all err in many ways. But if any man does not err in word, he is a perfect man and able also to control the whole body. [3] See how we put bits in the mouths of horses that they may obey us, and we control their whole bodies. [4] And observe ships. Though they are so great and are driven by fierce winds, yet they are directed with a very small rudder wherever the captain pleases. [5] Even so, the tongue is a little part of the body and boasts great things. See how great a forest a little fire kindles. [6] The tongue is a fire, a world of evil. The tongue is among the parts of the body, defiling the whole body, and setting the course of nature on fire, and it is set on fire by hell. [7] All kinds of beasts, and birds, and serpents, and things in the sea are tamed or have been tamed by mankind. [8] But no man can tame the tongue. It is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. [9] With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God. [10] Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. [11] Does a spring yield at the same opening sweet and bitter water? [12] Can the fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a vine, figs? So no spring can yield both salt water and fresh water.</p>
