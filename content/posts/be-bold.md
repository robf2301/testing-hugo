Boldness (confidence/courage) can be defined as the willingness to take risks and act innovatively. Christians should be known for their boldness. Scripture says we can do all things through Him that gives us strength. Phil 4:13

“The wicked flee though no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.”
‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭28:1‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.”
‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭13:6‬ ‭KJV‬‬

“Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.”
‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭4:16‬ ‭KJV‬‬

“Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,”
‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭10:19‬ ‭KJV‬‬

It’s important to know and understand that God loves us and if we follow Him we are forgiven. His love and acceptance gives us the confidence to ask Him anything and do great things for Him.

“Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do what pleases him.”
‭‭1 John‬ ‭3:21-22‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him.”
‭‭1 John‬ ‭5:14-15‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.”
‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭14:26‬ ‭KJV‬‬

“In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.”
‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭3:12‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming.”
‭‭1 John‬ ‭2:28‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus.”
‭‭1 John‬ ‭4:17‬ ‭NIV‬‬

Our courage can inspire other people to be courageous. All you need is Jesus, you don’t need a fancy education or degrees.

“When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus.”
‭‭Acts‬ ‭4:13‬ ‭NIV‬‬

Examples of bold moves in Scripture.
- Jacob wrestled with God and refused to let go of Him until He blessed him. Gen 32:22-31
- Abraham bargaining with God over the lives of the people in Sodom. Gen 18:22-33
- A woman suffered from a blood disease for 12 years. She had the courage to touch Jesus’ robe and was healed. Mat 9:20-22
- Some men brought a paralyzed man to Jesus. When they could not find a way to Jesus, they lowered him through the roof tiles and Jesus healed the paralyzed man. Luke 5:17-26

Let these words of God inspire you to be bold and fulfill your destiny.

“Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.””
‭‭Joshua‬ ‭1:9‬ ‭NIV‬‬
