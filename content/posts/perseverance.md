It can be defined as persisting in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success. To persevere you need an attitude of nothing and nobody is going to stop you. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Phil 4:13
God created us to persevere with His help. God planned in advance that He would lovingly create humans that interact with Him and He made laws to keep us safe from harm. When hardships come it is to purify us and make us even more
dependant on Him.

“And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.”
‭‭Jeremiah‬ ‭32:40‬ ‭KJV‬‬
John 6:34-40, John 10:28-29, Ps 73:24

“Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.

How do you manage to peservere in this world?

“Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. Do not quench the Spirit. Do not treat prophecies with contempt but test them all; hold on to what is good, reject every kind of evil. May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”
‭‭1 Thessalonians‬ ‭5:16-23‬ ‭NIV‬‬

We need to keep our eyes on Jesus and what is really of importance.

Jesus persevered on the cross for our salvation.

“Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.”
‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭12:1-2‬ ‭NIV‬‬
