  <p>God made the Earth in 6 days and then He rested. The New Testament says believers should enter the rest. Jesus died, took all the sin on Him and paid for everything. He said: “It’s finished.” Jesus did everything that was necessary for us to have an abundant life. God loves us and wants to bless us. Jesus stated numerous times that it is the Father’s will for us to be healed.</p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>“And whatever you ask in prayer, if you believe, you will receive.””<br>‭‭Matthew‬ ‭21:22‬ ‭MEV‬‬</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
   <p>“If you remain in Me, and My words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it shall be done for you.”<br>‭‭John‬ ‭15:7‬ ‭MEV‬‬</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>All that is left for us to do is believe and we will receive.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
