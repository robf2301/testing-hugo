  <p>In the beginning man was made in the image of God. In Jesus’ genealogy Luke refers to Adam as the son of God.</p>
  <p>Genesis 1:26-28 MEV<br>Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth." [27] So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. [28] God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves on the earth."</p>
  <p>Luke 3:38 MEV<br>who was the son of Enosh, who was the son of Seth, who was the son of Adam, who was the son of God.</p>
  <p>Later in the Old Testament the nation of Israel was considered the firstborn son of God. The pharoah lost his firsborn son, because he didn’t allow God’s firstborn to leave Egypt.</p>
  <p>Exodus 4:22-23 MEV<br>You shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the LORD: Israel is My son, even My firstborn. [23] So I say to you, "Let My son go, that he may serve Me. And if you refuse to let him go, I will slay your son, even your firstborn." ' "</p>
  <p>In the New Testament God gave His only Son as a sacrifice to save us.</p>
  <p>John 3:16 MEV<br>"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.</p>
  <p>With the new covenant, Jew and non - Jew became sons of God. The firsborn Son paid with His life to make us sons of God. We were made in His image and when He returns, we should be like Him.</p>
  <p>1 John 3:2 MEV<br>Beloved, now are we children of God, and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be. But we know that when He appears, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.</p>
  <p>Hebrews 2:10 MEV<br>For it was fitting for Him, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through suffering.</p>
  <p>Romans 8:10-17 MEV<br>And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is alive because of righteousness. [11] But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit that lives in you. [12] Therefore, brothers, we are debtors not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. [13] For if you live according to the flesh, you will die, but if through the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. [14] For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God. [15] For you have not received the spirit of slavery again to fear. But you have received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, "Abba, Father." [16] The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirits that we are the children of God, [17] and if children, then heirs: heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified with Him.<br>&nbsp;</p>
