  <p>It’s a biblical principle that idol worship can influence your bloodline. God’s blessing also follows if your ancestors worshipped the Lord. David’s faithfulness brought the blessing of Jesus being born from his bloodline.</p>
  <p>Exodus 20:3-6 MEV<br>You shall have no other gods before Me. [4] You shall not make for yourself any graven idol, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water below the earth. [5] You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them who hate Me, [6] and showing lovingkindness to thousands of them who love Me and keep My commandments.</p>
  <p>I know it sounds strange to confess for the sins of your ancestors, but it is biblical.</p>
  <p>Leviticus 26:40-42 MEV<br>But if they confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their treachery that they committed against Me, and also that they have walked contrary to Me, [41] and that I also have walked contrary to them and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts are humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity, [42] then will I remember My covenant with Jacob, and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.</p>
  <p>Nehemiah 9:2 MEV<br>The offspring of Israel separated themselves from all the foreigners and then stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.</p>
  <p>2 Chronicles 7:14 MEV<br>if My people, who are called by My name, will humble themselves and pray, and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.</p>
  <p>Generational curses or blessings didn’t stop with Jesus. The discilples were aware that the blind man’s infirmity could be due to the sins of his parents. In this case it wasn’t, but sometimes it is.</p>
  <p>John 9:1-2 TPT<br>Afterward, as Jesus walked down the street, he noticed a man blind from birth. [2] His disciples asked him, “Teacher, whose sin caused this guy’s blindness, his own, or the sin of his parents?”</p>
  <p>My grandfather was away in the second world war when my mom was born and my dad was away fighting in the border war when I was born. Patterns like this can be bloodline curses.The curse was broken with the birth of my children. Doctors will say people get the same disease as their parents due to their genetics. We know it’s probably due to bloodline curses. Sometimes a family might have a generational poverty spirit or people will have similar accidents as their parents. Christians become part of God’s family and we should experience life in full. We should therefore be aware of ancestral curses if we experience lack or trouble. Sometimes people will cut off all bloodline curses and still experience difficulties. The enemy comes to kill, steal and destroy and we are still in this world. The enemy plays unfair while Jesus always wants you to prosper. Jesus said we will experience trouble in this world, but He overcame and we should use our authority over the enemy. Cutting off ancestral curses is sometimes necessary to experience breakthrough.</p>
  <p>John 10:10 MEV<br>The thief does not come, except to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.</p>
  <p>3 John 1:2 MEV<br>Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, even as your soul is well.</p>
  <p>John 16:33 MEV<br>"I have told you these things so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But be of good cheer. I have overcome the world."</p>
  <p>Luke 10:19 MEV<br>Look, I give you authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. And nothing shall by any means hurt you.</p>
