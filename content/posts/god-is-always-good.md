God wants you to know that He is good.
> "For the Lord is good; His mercy endures forever, and His faithfulness to all generations."  
> Psalms 100:5 MEV
>
> "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed; His compassions do not fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness. "The Lord is my portion," says my soul, "therefore I will hope in Him." The Lord is good to those who wait for Him, to the soul who seeks Him. It is good that a man should wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord."  
> Lamentations 3:22-26 MEV
>
> "The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of distress; and He knows those who take refuge in Him."  
> Nahum 1:7 MEV

Disease, poverty, lack, addiction, depression, divorce, loss and sorrow come from satan. Satan came to kill, steal and destroy. Jesus came in order for us to experience abundant life.
> "The thief does not come, except to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly."  
> John 10:10 MEV

God sent Jesus to earth to die for us, but also to show us how to live. Jesus took authority over darkness and reigned and ruled. Jesus healed the sick, He cast out demons and brought freedom to the oppressed, He calmed the storm, He multiplied where there was lack and He remained obedient to God, until death.
> ""The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed;"  
> Luke 4:18 MEV
>
> "And being found in the form of a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross."  
> Philippians 2:8 MEV

God is always good therefore He sent His Son to die for you. God loves you with an everlasting love and wants you to be happy, healed, content and prosperous. Often people find themselves in difficult situations due to their own actions and even then God is good and wants to help you. Just turn to Him.
> "so you will say to them, Thus says the Lord of Hosts: Return to Me, and I will return to you, says the Lord of Hosts."  
> Zechariah 1:3 MEV
>
> "Pour out all your worries and stress upon him and leave them there, for he always tenderly cares for you."  
> 1 Peter 5:7 TPT
>
> "For I know the thoughts and plans that I have for you, says the Lord, thoughts and plans for welfare and peace and not for evil, to give you hope in your final outcome."  
> Jeremiah 29:11 AMPC
