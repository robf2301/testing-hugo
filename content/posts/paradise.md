  <p>PARADISE:<br>STRONG’S G3857 - paradeisos - a place of blessedness, from the base meaning of “garden”:- paradise.<br>NAVE’S TOPICAL BIBLE REFERENCE: park or garden, park (Ecclesiastes 2:5), forest (Nehemiah 2:8), home of those who die in Christ (Luke 23:43).<br>THAYER LEXICON: Heaven, park, garden, the part of Hades which was thought by the later Jews to be the abode of the souls of pious until the resurrection: but some understand this to be a heavenly paradise,<br>the upper regions of the heavens. According to the early church Fathers, the paradise in which our first parents dwelt before the fall still exists, neither on the earth or in the heavens, but above and beyond the world.</p>
  <p>Even on the cross Jesus didn’t think of Himself. His selfless love made it possible for the criminal next to Him to enter Paradise with Him. &nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>Luke 23:43-46 TPT<br>Jesus responded, “I promise you—this very day you will enter paradise with me.” [44] It was now only midday, yet the whole world became dark for three hours as the light of the sun faded away. [45] And suddenly in the temple the thick veil hanging in the Holy Place was ripped in two! [46] Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Father, I surrender my Spirit into your hands.” And he took his last breath and died.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Paul was taken to the third Heaven and/or paradise. Some believe that there are 7 Heavens, but the Bible doesn’t mention anything about it.</p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>2 Corinthians 12:2-4 TPT<br>Someone I’m acquainted with, who is in union with Christ, was swept away fourteen years ago in an ecstatic experience. He was taken into the third heaven, but I’m not sure if he was in his body or out of his body—only God knows. [3] And I know that this man (again, I’m not sure if he was still in his body or taken out of his body—God knows) [4] was caught up in an ecstatic experience and brought into paradise, where he overheard many wondrous and inexpressible secrets that were so sacred that no mortal is permitted to repeat them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Those who follow Jesus wholeheartedly will eat from the Tree of Life in paradise.</p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>Revelation 2:7 TPT<br>The one whose heart is open let him listen carefully to what the Spirit is saying now to all the churches. To the one who overcomes I will give access to feast on the fruit of the Tree of Life that is found in the paradise of God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Life in paradise:</p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>Revelation 22:1-5 TPT<br>Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, flowing with water clear as crystal, continuously pouring out from the throne of God and of the Lamb. [2] The river was flowing in the middle of the street of the city, and on either side of the river was the Tree of Life, with its twelve kinds of ripe fruit according to each month of the year. The leaves of the Tree of Life are for the healing of the nations. [3] And every curse will be broken and no longer exist, for the throne of God and of the Lamb will be there in the city. His loving servants will serve him; [4] they will always see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. [5] Night will be no more. They will never need the light of the sun or a lamp, because the Lord God will shine on them. And they will reign as kings forever and ever!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Most English Bible translations refer 3 times to paradise. The Passion Translation has an extra reference to paradise (Garden of Eden) in Genesis 2.</p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>Genesis 2:8-9 TPT<br>Then YAHWEH-God planted a lush garden paradise in the East, in the Land of Delight, and there he placed the man he had formed. [9] YAHWEH-God made all kinds of beautiful trees to grow there—fruitful trees to satisfy the taste. In the middle of the garden, he planted the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I believe the Garden of Eden was a place that represented Heaven on Earth. Once Adam and Eve sinned, they were expelled from the garden and the paradise lifestyle. Only after Jesus came, people got the oppurtunity to have full access to God. People could experience Heaven on Earth again by having an intimate relationship with Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Jesus gave us the authority to bring light to the darkness here on Earth. We will continue doing so, till we die and receive eternal life in Paradise and Heaven.</p>
